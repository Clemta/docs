# Fixed Assets API

The Fixed Assets API allows partners to programmatically manage fixed assets in the accounting system. This API is designed for partners who want to integrate Clemta's fixed asset management services into their own platforms.

## Authentication

See [Authentication](/api-reference/authentication) for how to authenticate requests.

## Rate Limiting

The Fixed Assets API is subject to rate limiting to ensure fair usage and system stability. Please refer to our [Rate Limiting](/api-reference/rate-limiting) documentation for more details.
