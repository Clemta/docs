# Clemta API Rate Limiting

The Clemta API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage and system stability. This document explains how rate limiting works and how to interpret the rate limit headers.

## Rate Limit Types

The Clemta API uses two different rate limiting strategies depending on the endpoint:

1. **API Key-based Rate Limiting**: Applied to the `/formations` endpoint
2. **Company ID-based Rate Limiting**: Applied to the `/formations/{company_id}` endpoint

## Rate Limit Headers

All Clemta API responses include headers that provide information about rate limits:

### Common Headers

- `X-RateLimit-API`: Displays your API key's rate limit (e.g., "60 requests per minute")
- `X-RateLimit-Status-Endpoint`: Shows the rate limit for the status endpoint per company ID (e.g., "60 requests per minute per company ID")

### Endpoint-specific Headers

- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Number of requests remaining in the current time window
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum number of requests allowed per minute
- `X-RateLimit-Type`: Indicates which rate limit type is being applied ("api_key" or "company_id")

When a rate limit is exceeded, you'll also receive:

- `Retry-After`: Seconds to wait before making another request (typically 60 seconds)

## Rate Limit Behavior

### For `/formations` Endpoint

- Rate limiting is based on your API key.
- Each API key has its own rate limit defined when the key is created.
- The rate limit applies across all requests made with that API key.

### For `/formations/{company_id}` Endpoint

- Rate limiting is based on the company ID in the URL parameter.
- Default limit is 60 requests per minute per company ID.
- This allows you to check status for multiple companies without hitting API key limits.

## Rate Limit Errors

When a rate limit is exceeded, the API will respond with:

- HTTP Status Code: `429 Too Many Requests`
- Error Code: `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`
- Error Message: "Rate limit exceeded" or "Rate limit exceeded for this company ID"

## Best Practices

1. **Implement exponential backoff**: When receiving a 429 response, wait the suggested time in the `Retry-After` header and then retry with increasing delays.
2. **Monitor your usage**: Keep track of the `X-RateLimit-Remaining` header to avoid hitting limits.
3. **Batch requests**: When possible, batch multiple operations into a single API call.
4. **Cache responses**: Cache status responses when appropriate to reduce the number of API calls.

## Example Rate Limit Headers

### Successful Request to `/company`

```
X-RateLimit-API: 60 requests per minute
X-RateLimit-Status-Endpoint: 60 requests per minute per company ID
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 59
X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
X-RateLimit-Type: api_key
```

### Rate Limited Request to `/formations/{company_id}`

```
X-RateLimit-API: 60 requests per minute
X-RateLimit-Status-Endpoint: 60 requests per minute per company ID
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0
X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
X-RateLimit-Type: company_id
Retry-After: 60
```
