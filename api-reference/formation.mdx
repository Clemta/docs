# Formation API

The Formation API allows partners to programmatically initiate company formations and check their status. This API is designed for partners who want to integrate Clemta's company formation services into their own platforms.

## Authentication

All Formation API endpoints require authentication using an API key. The API key should be included in the `X-API-KEY` header of each request.

```
X-API-KEY: your_api_key
```

To obtain an API key, please contact our support team.

## Base URL

All API endpoints are relative to the base URL:

```
https://api.clemta.com
```

## Rate Limiting

The Formation API is subject to rate limiting to ensure fair usage and system stability. Please refer to our [Rate Limiting](/api-reference/rate-limiting) documentation for more details.
