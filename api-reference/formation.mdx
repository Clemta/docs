# Formation API

The Formation API allows partners to programmatically initiate company formations and check their status. This API is designed for partners who want to integrate Clemta's company formation services into their own platforms.

## Authentication

See [Authentication](/api-reference/authentication) for how to authenticate requests.

## Rate Limiting

The Formation API is subject to rate limiting to ensure fair usage and system stability. Please refer to our [Rate Limiting](/api-reference/rate-limiting) documentation for more details.
