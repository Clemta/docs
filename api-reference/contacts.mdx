# Contacts API

The Contacts API allows partners to programmatically manage contacts (customers and vendors) in the accounting system. This API is designed for partners who want to integrate Clemta's contact management services into their own platforms.

## Authentication

See [Authentication](/api-reference/authentication) for how to authenticate requests.

## Rate Limiting

The Contacts API is subject to rate limiting to ensure fair usage and system stability. Please refer to our [Rate Limiting](/api-reference/rate-limiting) documentation for more details.
