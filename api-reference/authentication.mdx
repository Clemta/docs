# Authentication

All Clemta APIs use API key authentication. Include your API key in the `X-API-KEY` header on every request.

## Header

```
X-API-KEY: your_api_key
```

## Getting an API Key

There is no public signup. Your credentials are provisioned by Clemta. If you do not have an API key, contact us at tech@clemta.com.

## Authorization (Access Control)

Clemta authorizes requests based on your API key and associated partner account. You can only access resources that belong to your account.

- Company resources are only accessible if they are linked to your partner account
- Contacts and other accounting resources are restricted to your companies
- Some endpoints may apply additional resource-level checks

If a request is authenticated but not authorized, the API returns 403 with `ACCESS_DENIED`.

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Access denied",
  "data": null,
  "error": { "code": "ACCESS_DENIED" }
}
```

## Example Requests

<CodeGroup dropdown>

```bash curl.sh
curl -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY" \
     https://api.clemta.com/formations
```

```typescript fetch.ts
await fetch("https://api.clemta.com/formations", {
  headers: { "X-API-KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY" },
});
```

```python requests.py
import requests
requests.get('https://api.clemta.com/formations', headers={'X-API-KEY': 'YOUR_API_KEY'})
```

```go http.go
req, _ := http.NewRequest("GET", "https://api.clemta.com/formations", nil)
req.Header.Set("X-API-KEY", "YOUR_API_KEY")
```

</CodeGroup>

## Notes

- Do not embed API keys in client-side code.
- Use separate keys per environment (sandbox vs production).
